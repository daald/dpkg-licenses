dpkg-licenses
=============
A command line tool which lists the licenses of all installed packages in a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu)

How it works
------------

Almost every package in Debian contains a copyright file in
`/usr/share/doc/<packagename>/copyright`. Unfortunately, this file was
initially a plain-text file without a specified format, not even specified
what it should contain. In 2012, Debian tried to change this by specifying
a machine-readable format (http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep5/). Until now,
this specification is not a requirement, and many developers don't care
about it, so that reading out the licenses of all packages is still a pain.
But in business, there is a regular demand for such license information.

A google search showed me that until now nobody tried to parse these files
or found another approach to lists the licenses:
 - http://askubuntu.com/questions/247757/how-do-you-find-the-licenses-for-everything-installed-on-your-system/620069#620069
 - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1884753/license-info-of-a-deb-package#1884785

dpkg-licenses tries to read these well-formatted licenses file and has
multiple fallbacks for the case that it isn't well-formatted. You can
probably imagine how hard it is to read a license from a unformatted
plain-text file.

Feel free to try this tool. Any suggestions are welcome.

Sample output
-------------

    $ ./dpkg-licenses
    St  Name             Version               Arch   Description                                   Licenses
    --  ----             -------               ----   -----------                                   --------
    ii  accountsservice  0.6.35-0ubuntu7.2     amd64  query and manipulate user account informatio  GPL-2+ GPL-3+
    ii  acl              2.2.52-1              amd64  Access control list utilities                 GPL LGPL-2.1
    ii  acpi-support     0.142                 amd64  scripts for handling many ACPI events         GPL-2+
    ii  acpid            1:2.0.21-1ubuntu2     amd64  Advanced Configuration and Power Interface e  GPL-2
    ii  adduser          3.113+nmu3ubuntu3     all    add and remove users and groups               GPL-2
    ii  alsa-base        1.0.25+dfsg-0ubuntu4  all    ALSA driver configuration files               GPL-2
    ii  alsa-utils       1.0.27.2-1ubuntu2     amd64  Utilities for configuring and using ALSA      GPL-2
    ii  anacron          2.3-20ubuntu1         amd64  cron-like program that doesn't go by time     GPL-2

CSV format
-------------

To get parsable format without shortened fields, use `--csv` (`-c`) flag:

    $ ./dpkg-licenses -c
    "St","Name","Version","Arch","Description","Licenses"
    "ii","accountsservice","0.6.35-0ubuntu7.2","amd64","query and manipulate user account information","GPL-2+ GPL-3+"
    "ii","acl","2.2.52-1","amd64","Access control list utilities","GPL LGPL-2.1"
    "ii","acpid","1:2.0.21-1ubuntu2","amd64","Advanced Configuration and Power Interface event daemon","GPL-2"
    ...

Alternate root
--------------

To run dpkg-licenses on an alternative root directory (for example, an unpacked tarball of a Debian installation), add the `--root=<path>` argument:

    $ ./dpkg-licenses --root='/path/to/alternative/root/'

Alternate separator
-------------------

By default, license names in the output are separated with a space character. If this is not desirable, you can change the separator character:

    $ ./dpkg-licenses -c --separator='|'
    # or
    $ ./dpkg-licenses -c -s='|'
    "St","Name","Version","Arch","Description","Licenses"
    "ii","2to3","3.8.2-0ubuntu2","all","2to3 binary using python3","GPL-compatible|GPL-compatible licenses"

Note that double quotes (") are not appropriate for use as separators and will cause CSV output to format incorrectly.

Output quality
-------------

The output quality on an average workspace Ubuntu installation looks like this:

    $ ./dpkg-licenses >output.txt 2>errors.txt
    $ cat output.txt | cut -c135- | wc -l
    2230
    $ cat output.txt | cut -c135- | grep unknown | wc -l
    228

Interpretation:
 2230 installed packages, success rate of tool is 1âˆ’(228/2230) = 90%

However, there is still a lot of garbage:
